## Libratum (balanced in latin)

### Rebalance your crypto


Libratum helps you to rebalance your cryptos to have always the same percentage of each. 
Let see an example! Imagine you want to have 50% of the total amount(in €) in each crypto, crypto A and crypto B. Crypto A cost 2€ and you have 5 coins and crypto B cost 3€ and you have 10 coins, the tool will sell crypto B to have more crypto A and comply with the % amount and you will have 10 A coins and 6,66 B coins.
